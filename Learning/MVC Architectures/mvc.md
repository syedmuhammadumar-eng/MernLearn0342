# user > view > controller > model > database

- here user goes to view , view goes to controller and controlle goes to model and model goes to database

- Why we Use Mvc Architecture?
- to split our application into model view and controller to work of ease 

- in our case: 
- Clinet is View
- Server is Model and Controller



# USER

# VIEW

- request process
- rendering the content
- ui layer

# CONTROLLER

- returning the data
- bussiness logic or server code

# MODEL

- handle all interaction with database


# DATABASE
